  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact information you submit</strong> (for example, your name and email when you join the waitlist, apply for the pilot, or contact support).</li>
    <li><strong>Optional details you provide</strong> (for example, role, organization, state(s), headcount range, and the topics you want help with).</li>
    <li><strong>Basic usage analytics</strong> (for example, page views and feature usage) to understand what’s helpful and improve the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical logs</strong> needed to run and secure the Service (for example, IP address, browser/device type, and error logs).</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies or similar technologies</strong> for basic functionality and analytics, if enabled.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not require employee Social Security numbers, bank details, payroll files, or other sensitive employee personal data to use HRCC.</p>

  <h2>Forms and pilot applications</h2>
  <p>If you submit a form (Pilot, Waitlist, or Contact), we may collect your name, email, company, role, and any information you include. We use this to evaluate applications and respond to you.</p>
  <p>Our site uses Netlify for hosting and may route form submissions through third-party form/email delivery providers so submissions are delivered to support@hrcompliancecompass.com.</p>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the Service and respond to your requests (pilot, waitlist, contact/support).</li>
    <li>Review pilot applications and onboard pilot users.</li>
    <li>Improve the site/product (debugging, performance, usability, and content quality).</li>
    <li>Send operational messages you request or that are necessary (pilot access, updates, critical notices).</li>
    <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and enforce our Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we don’t do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></li>
    <li>We do not use your submissions to train public AI models.</li>
    <li>We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We may share information with service providers as needed to operate the Service, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hosting and forms:</strong> Our website and form submissions may be processed by our hosting provider (for example, Netlify) and form/email routing providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> To send confirmations, pilot/waitlist updates, and support responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments (if/when enabled):</strong> A payment processor (for example, Stripe) to process subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand performance and improve content.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may also disclose information if required by law, to protect rights and safety, or in connection with a business transaction (such as a merger or asset sale).</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep information only as long as needed for the purposes above (including running the pilot), unless we must retain it for legal/operational reasons. You can request deletion by emailing us.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Request access to what you submitted.</li>
    <li>Request corrections.</li>
    <li>Request deletion (subject to legal/operational needs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards. No online system is 100% secure, but we work to reduce risk.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. When we do, we’ll update the “Last updated” date above.</p>
